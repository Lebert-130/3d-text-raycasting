# 3d-text-raycasting

A 3D ASCII-Style raycaster, the original code was taken from here: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/CommandLineFPS.
All the changes that were made were adding loading map text file support, took me 1 day and a half to make the loading text file support
cpp, comes with 2 sample text files and 2 exes: one with a minimap, and one without one

Map sizes:

Maze - 25x25
Test - 10x10

Recommended spawn coordinates:

Maze - (4,3)
Test - (5,5)
